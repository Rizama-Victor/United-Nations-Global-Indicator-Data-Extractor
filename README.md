## 🚀 Project Overview

The goal of this project was to scrape data from the United Nations Database - Global Indicators to gather comprehensive global indicator data for every country in the world, as well as various regions. The project focused on four key indicators:
- Economic Indicators
- Environmental and Infrastructural Indicators
- General Information
- Social Indicators
